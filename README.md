## Extraction of campsite availability in rocky mountain national park

Rocky mountain national park publishes a PDF of current campsite availability for a 6 month window. While this is a great resource, it is tedious to navigate. This project uses [tabula-java](https://github.com/tabulapdf/tabula-java) to extract the pdf into csv files, and python / pandas to reflow the data back into structured databases.
